            SPORT BIKE
        </h2>
        <p>
            The sports genre of motorcycles is meant for speed and agility with forward-leaning ergonomics ready to carve some corners while riding.
            One of the largest differences with a Sport-typemotorcycle is its weight. They are generally lighter motorcycles made from a lot of aluminum and lighter materials to increase side-to-side maneuverability.
            The seat height is usually on the higher end to lean the motorcycle farther without scraping foot pegs or fairings.
            Shorter riders may be on their tiptoes with the taller seat height. Suzuki is considered the starter of this type of motorcycle in the 1980s with the GSXR line-up.
            Still going strong today, weâ€™d recommend looking at the <a href="https://suzukicycles.com/sportbike/2022/gsx-r600">Suzuki GSXR600</a> as a good motorcycle for this type. It has enough power to do everything, and with added accessories, it can be made into a comfortable (within reason) weekend sport-touring motorcycle.
